    <p>Hello! My name is Sam Mosher. I'm a 21-year-old journalism student at the University of Missouri. I'm studying multimedia production in the school's Convergence Journalism program. With my experience, I can manage and produce detailed multimedia stories, choose the elements that best fit the story I want to tell and see the production through to completion.</p>
    <p>I'm from St. Charles, Missouri. I grew up admiring my uncle and aunt, Todd Ummelmann and Lara Moritz, who work for KMBC in Kansas City. Their work includes interviewing President Obama, documenting the Ferguson riots and covering professional sports. They ignited my passion for journalism, and now, I want to use multimedia to tell stories that inspire people, just as their work inspired me.</p>

    <p>Right now, I try to inspire people with my podcast, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-993471708">Kids in College</a>, a weekly conversational show about popular culture and daily college life. My co-host Jacob Douglas and I have shared the best, worst and most hilarious parts of our lives for more than 100 straight weeks. We often feature notable guests like musical artists, fellow content creators or even <a href="https://twitter.com/gameovergreggy" target="_blank">Kinda Funny co-founder Greg Miller</a>. In addition to journalism and podcasting, I have a passion for running, writing about music and reading or watching science fiction and fantasy stories.</p>

    <p>My perfect night is going out for pizza, shopping at a record shop and seeing a movie with friends or family. My favorite album is Tame Impala's "Currents," and my favorite film is "La La Land."
